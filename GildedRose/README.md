# What is Gilded Rose?

Gilded Rose is a simple codebase that is often used as a kata for practicing refactoring skills. The code simulates a store that sells various items, each with its own rules for how its quality and sell-by date change over time.

We are lucky, because this codebase has a comprehensive set of requirements that outline how each type of item should behave. This makes it an excellent candidate for practicing refactoring techniques.

More often than not, there are no documentation, or tests, and the original coders left the company 20 years ago...


See Requirements.md for the full list of requirements.
