This repository contains the code for the Gilded Rose kata, a popular coding exercise used to practice refactoring and improving legacy code.

It was used to demonstrate refactoring of a legacy codebase in Equinor Knovember 2025.

## Getting Started
The talk was Powerpoint-free, so the README was used to document the steps taken during the refactoring process.

There is a number of branches, each representing a new section of the talk.

Check out each one to follow along with the refactoring journey.

Each branch contains the code changes done in the previous step (if any).

The last branch (11.Refactored) contains the final refactored code.
