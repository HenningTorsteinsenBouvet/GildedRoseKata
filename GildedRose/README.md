# Rules for refactoring legacy code

# Do not refactor unless you have a good reason

## Reasons to refactor
- There is a business reason to do so
- You need to add a new feature, and the existing code makes it hard to do so.
- You need to fix a bug, and the existing code makes it hard to do so.
- You need to improve performance, and the existing code makes it hard to do so.


- ## Reasons NOT to refactor
- Don't break working code! Every change has a risk.
- "I don't like it" is not a good reason.
- "I didn't write it" is not a good reason.
- "I want to try out a new framework" is not a good reason.
